EDStarRating  ![Version Badge](https://go-shields.herokuapp.com/license-BSD-blue.png)
===============

A configurable star rating control for OSX and iOS, similar to those found in iTunes and the App Store. Fork of https://github.com/erndev/EDStarRating including support for resizing large star images on iOS. Additionally I have rewritten the iOS sample project with the additional presentation of the resizing code.

###Installation

The easiest way to install this fork of EDStarRating is via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Add this line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'EDStarRating', :git => 'https://github.com/martinpfannemueller/EDStarRating.git'
```

and run `pod install`.

You can also install it manually by copying these two files to your project: EDStarRating.h and EDStarRating.m

### Usage

 In order to use EDStarRating, you can instantiate it programmatically, or create a custom view in Interface Builder and assign it to an ivar of your app. Once you have an instance, you can use the control properties to configure it.

Example:

```objective-c

  starRating.starImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"star.png"];
  starRating.starHighlightedImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"starhighlighted.png"];
  starRating.minRating = 1.0; // Prevents ratings below a minimum
  starRating.maxRating = 5.0;
  starRating.delegate = self;
  starRating.horizontalMargin = 12;
  starRating.editable=YES;
  starRating.displayMode=EDStarRatingDisplayFull;


  starRating.rating= 2.5;

  // Resizing of large star image by setting starSize property
  starRating.starSize = 20;

```
### tintColor support in iOS 7
If you pass to the control a template UIImage (created using rendering mode (UIImageRenderingModeAlwaysTemplate), EDStarRating will tint that image using the control's tintColor property.


### Compatiblity
This control should work in ARC and not ARC projects. On OS X 10.6+ and iOS 4.x+.
But it's only tested it with ARC enabled in 10.8+ and iOS 6.0+. Let me now if it works fine for you in other environments.
